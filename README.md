WASD for character movement 
Arrow Keys to move the world 

Can you beat all 10 levels? 

Protips: 
- Try defeating enemies by shifting them into traps or off the board 
- Keep track of the door - otherwise, you'll have to search for it 

Update: Apparently our game inspired a comic from one of our players, which adds a (strange, dystopian, and unintentional) backstory to the game. You can find it under the 'An Interpretation of Rubiq's Garden From a Player (Comic)' link above.
